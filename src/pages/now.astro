    <h2>Season of Awareness</h2>

    <p>
      I'm in a Season of Awareness—practicing noticing things, paying attention, being present.
      Not as a productivity technique, but as a way of being in the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Making</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Working on game development projects</li>
      <li>Exploring machine learning and AI</li>
      <li>Writing when the words come</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reading</h2>

    <p>
      Always have a few books going. Currently exploring consciousness, game design theory,
      and whatever poetry catches my attention.
    </p>

    <h2>Thinking About</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>How to love well and be loved well</li>
      <li>The nature of time and how we experience it</li>
      <li>What it means to truly see another person</li>
      <li>How to build things that reward curiosity</li>
    </ul>
