    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="intro__text">
      I'm Alex. I make things sometimes—games, mostly. I write when I have something I'm trying to understand.

    <p>
      I like things with discoverable depth: surfaces that reward curiosity, experiences that reveal themselves slowly. Games that teach you to break them. Conversations that wander somewhere unexpected.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lately I've been thinking about how attention works. What we notice and what we miss. The gap between seeing someone and <em>seeing</em> them.
    </p>

    <h2>Some things I keep returning to</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The transitions between seasons—how you can feel a day shift</li>
      <li>Why some games feel alive and others don't</li>
      <li>The way time moves differently when you're paying attention</li>
      <li>What people mean versus what they say</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Seasons</h2>

    <p>
      Since 2016, I've organized my life into "Seasons"—loose, intentional periods where I let one thing take up more space than usual. Season of Awareness. Season of Making. Season of Writing. It's less a system than a way of noticing what's already asking for attention.
