    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="intro__text">
      I'm Alex. I think the meaning of life is to love and to be loved—and I'm curious about how to do both better.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a maker of things—games, words, systems. I believe in <strong>discoverable depth</strong>:
      surfaces that reward curiosity, experiences that reveal themselves through exploration.
    </p>

    <p>
      My mind bridges scientific precision and poetic sensibility. I think about quantum mechanics
      and also "the smell of the air on a night where spring and summer converse lightly."
    </p>

    <h2>What I'm Curious About</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Game design</strong> — particularly emergent play and breaking games in ways developers intended but didn't predict</li>
      <li><strong>Personal growth</strong> — not as self-help performativity, but as genuine, patient cultivation</li>
      <li><strong>Deep questions</strong> — time, consciousness, what it means to know someone</li>
      <li><strong>Small beautiful things</strong> — light through leaves, the transitions between seasons, the way sound travels at night</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Seasons Framework</h2>

    <p>
      Since 2016, I've been living in "Seasons"—intentional periods of focus on specific areas of growth.
      Season of Awareness. Season of Making. Season of Writing. Season of Agency. Season of Building.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's not about productivity or optimization. It's about paying attention to what wants to grow
      and giving it room to breathe.
