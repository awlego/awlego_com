Some Men Sleep

Some men sleep
While I am awake
The sun hides for you
Exhalations of your night
But for me it shines
In the echos of your breath
Found in early writ
Simple, short, sweet
Some men sleep
While I am awake

Written at 3:30am when I couldn't sleep one evening, thinking about sending messages to someone who will wake up before me, writen from their perspective.
