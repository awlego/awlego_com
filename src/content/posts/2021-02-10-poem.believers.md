Believers

Dark heels clicked
striking the
cobblestone;
confidence.

A shared spell
Spun with warmth;
finger tips
in night air

He shouldered
dark threads spun
crisp and clean,
accents, bold.

She draped white
soft with gold
flowing like
rivers old

He was iron
a soft strength,
pliable
with furnace.

She was heat
from nothing,
like a flame
glorious.

Tender sways
hide still their
frail knowledge
shared in myth.

Known only
as bare truth.
Believers
'neath night sky.

My imagination brought me a man and a woman dancing by themselves in a square late at night and it was beautiful, so I tried to write it down.
