Flying

I've never run that fast
Definitely not!
Arms pulling hard
Muscles pulling against their inertia
Legs in big big circles
as feet fly across blacktop
That RUSH!
Not of the wind,
though there is that
But of elation
I've never run that fast

It was over a year since I started running when I decided to try a full out sprint. There was this thrill to it that was indescribable. Just this pure rush.
