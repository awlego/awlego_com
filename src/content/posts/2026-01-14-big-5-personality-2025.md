I'm interested in tracking my personality test scores over time. Here are my results for 2025 and the changes from the last time I took this test (2022):

My scores on the "Big 5 Personality Test" from [Truity.com](https://www.truity.com/personality-test/17315/test-results/12497855):
1. Openness: 87.5% (-6.5%)
2. Conscientiousness: 69% (+21%)
3. Extraversion: 46% (-8%)
4. Agreeableness: 69% (-6%)
5. Neuroticism: 8% (+2%)

The big jump in Conscientiousness is interesting—that's the largest change I've seen across any of these tests.
