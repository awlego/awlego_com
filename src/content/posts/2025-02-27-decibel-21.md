Some things from around the internet I consumed this week and found interesting:

1. Reality has a surprising amount of detail (Essay)
2. Jacob Collier on Mythical Kitchen’s Last Meal (45 min YouTube video)
3. Technology Connections on Algorithms (37 min YouTube video)

   ![](/images/decibel/decibel-21-026041de.webp "A surreal, futuristic dining scene featuring an old wooden table in the middle of a digital, glitchy world. On the table, there is a half-eaten meal consisting of bread and wine, evoking a symbolic or biblical reference to 'Jacob's Last Meal.' The environment around the table is a cyberpunk-inspired landscape with floating holographic screens, pixelated distortions, and intrusive notifications appearing in mid-air. The contrast between the traditional meal and the high-tech, chaotic background reflects a struggle between reality and digital overload. The lighting is eerie, with warm candlelight illuminating the table while cold neon lights and digital noise dominate the surroundings.")

## 1. [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail)

I quite enjoyed this piece. It reminds me of a [project](https://awlego.com/blog/on-smell-cultivation/) I did a while back where I substantially increased my awareness (and maybe my ability) to smell things. A question I like to ask myself is, “If there were [an airplane overhead] would I notice it?”, where [an airplane overhead] could be replaced by all sorts of observations. Common ones I’ve found useful:

* If this food was making me feel worse, would I notice it?
* If my body was experiencing pain right now, would I notice it?
* If an interaction energized or drained me, would I notice it?
* If my body was telling me it needed something with a subtle signal (water, food, movement, sleep, etc), would I notice it?

Go deep. Pay attention. Notice.

A combination of two things I greatly enjoy! Jacob Collier and Mythical Kitchen’s Last Meal show.

The premise of the show is that the host asks a guest what their “dream last meal” might look like, then they eat that meal together during an interview. Conversation weaves around each of the dishes, the memories that inspired the choices, what the guest holds dear, and eventually some more existential questions.

I suppose a word of warning is warranted: in the words of my girlfriend: “i still think that show is creepy, but i think you loving it is adorable :P”

The show is great. I don’t know what she’s talking about. Who’s going to let a little talk of death get in the way of good food and good conversation? Not me!

Jacob’s vibrancy, kindness, joys (and sorrows) from life really comes through in this interview and I find that that same feelings are captured in his music. If you ever have a chance to be a part of his live choirs (by attending any of his concerts) I suggest you do so!

Personal favorite songs in case you want an ‘Alex’ starting point to Jacob’s music:

* All I Need (with Mahalia & Ty Dolla $ign)
* Make Me Cry
* Little Blue (feat. Brandi Carlile)
* Feel (feat. Lianne La Havas)
* She Put Sunshine

## 3. [Technology Connections on Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA)

Technology connections is one of my favorite YouTube channels. If this is your first time seeing it I recommend \*not\* watching this video first. Go find one his videos about a topic you might find interesting and get a feel for his explanations of practical technologies and for what the channel is normally about. I wouldn’t want to ruin a wonderful channel for you with a first taste of ‘old man yells at the internet’.

I don’t have the time this week to do this the topic of online algorithms (and AI) justice, but I want to make two points.

1. I'm hugely on board with curating your own information feeds.

This is super important! Be an active participant in choosing what food your brain eats. Follow enriching people on Twitter, not the ones who make your blood boil. If news sites are making you depressed, stay away from them. The information you surround yourself with and consume makes a difference in your lived experience and eventually who you are. The world is so full of books, songs, poetry, music, videos, games, blogs, tweets, and anything and everything that it’s not worth your time to consistently consume bad content.

Also remember that bad content is not information you disagree with.

2. I think thinking machines are worth (safely) pursuing

He is very against offloading thinking to machines and thinks someone who wants that would be crazy -- that it represents a supremely lazy anti-intellectualism (that is clearly bad).

There is lots of knowledge work whose output I care about, but since I am a but a mortal human with limited time, I choose to not pursue. Here I think thinking machines can offer much help. We should build them safely and try our best to understand them, ourselves, and our interactions with them, yet I \*do\* see real value in chasing thinking machines.

Until next time.
