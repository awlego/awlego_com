Lights Are Off

The lights are off now
As I tell you my fears
I'm naked and afraid
And Sharing makes it better.
You clutch my shoulder
As your worries seep out
A warmth in the darkness
Certainty... for now.
The lights are off now
And there is love to make.
But we both know
That it has already been made.

I'm not 100% done with this piece, but maybe it will stay unfinished. I really like the line "But we both know
That it has already been made."
