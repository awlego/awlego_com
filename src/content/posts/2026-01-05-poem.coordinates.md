Coordinates
by Alex Wilson

The tyrannosaur is not gone.
It stands at 66 million years south,
the way Chicago is west of here--
You could walk there if your legs were made of something other than years.
The ferns might remember the route.

And the tyrannosaur is not waiting,
it is mid-stride,
mouth open to the humid air,
unaware that from here it looks like bone,
like silence, like a thing that ended rather
than a thing that continues
in a country we cannot visit.
