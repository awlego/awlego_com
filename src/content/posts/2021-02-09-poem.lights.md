Lights

June is an endless orgy of light
December is a seductive dance of color
Life is harsh but beautiful. Beauty is full here. Full.
It has to be, because life is harsh.

A poem I wrote while traveling above the Arctic Circle in Norway with my grandparents. I don't actually think life is harsh, but the stark mountains and cold water made it seem appropriate for the poem.
