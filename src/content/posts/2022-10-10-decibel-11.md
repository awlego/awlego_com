Here’s some things from around the internet I consumed this week and found interesting:

1. [Easy or Hard](https://xkcd.com/2682/) (xkcd comic)
2. [Richard Feynman Lecture -- "Los Alamos From Below"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY-u1qyRM5w)

 (audio lecture, ~1 hour)
3. [Visa on Money and Status](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1579018818848190465?s=20&t=iTpvHNjLXuFEaDU7VGFRVQ) (tweet)

Below, find some of my thoughts.

### 1. [Easy or Hard](https://xkcd.com/2682/)

Did you know Tylenol also works for emotional pain?

### 2. **Richard Feynman Lecture -- "Los Alamos From Below"**

With murmurs of nuclear weapon usage risk increasing, I have been more interested in learning about the development of the first bomb. In this talk Richard Feynman details his experiences “from below” because he was a lowly graduate student when he joined the project and knew almost nothing of the nuclear physics involved. The talk is filled with jokes and humor and I found it wildly entertaining. In particular I recommend the 8 minutes on censorship starting at [22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY-u1qyRM5w&t=1345s)

### 3. [Visa on Money and Status](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1579018818848190465?s=20&t=iTpvHNjLXuFEaDU7VGFRVQ)

Some readers might find such statements obvious, but I’ve found that for all the times I’ve read obvious things, I’ve found many still that key into my mind in a way that seeds useful thought. Here I’m reminded of a few things.

First, I like to collect good questions. A bit ago I came across this one very similar to Visa’s idea:

“If you had more money, how would you use it to become more *\*you\**?”

I found answering this question to be a useful exercise for two reasons.

1. Encourages me to be specific, which unearths deeper values.
2. Encourages to think about money for its instrumental value — it’s harder to accidentally think it has intrinsic value.

Second, is the concept of "dreamlining": sketching out a hyper-specific way the future could be, to instill life and inspiration and a sense of direction. I sat down a while ago and wrote down a few different 500 word futures for myself. Being specific led me to ponder various values and scenarios and what kinds of forces might be at play in those worlds.

A highlight of many of the futures I wrote were deep meaningful friendships. Noticing this, I have been taking a few small, active changes towards encouraging the development of both new and stronger friendships, both of which take small amounts of money and status, but at really quite reasonable levels.
